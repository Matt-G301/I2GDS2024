Simple RNAseq Pipline for Comparing Experimental Techniques
    This process is in use for comparing differant techniques for surfaceSEQ but can easily be adapted to other methods that require comparing RNA data sets to each other to determine results present in up to 5 RNAsew runs
Programs used
    *sra-tools
    *trimmomatic
    *Hisat2
    *featureCounts, (installed as subreads)
Installation via conda is strongly recomended, to install run the comands
